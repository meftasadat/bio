💼 EXPERIENCE
LOBLAW DIGITAL | STAFF SOFTWARE ENGINEER
Aug 2018 - Present | Toronto, Canada

2025 Q3: Built LD Internal Agent Orchestration Engine Alfred that is being used to deploy 10+ conversational agentic use cases. Alfred uses open source stack like LangGraph, LangFuse, LiteLLM, Gradio, and MCP servers.

2025 Q1: Designed and deployed LLM-powered features, incorporating LLMOps principles. Built batch prediction, monitoring, and orchestration capable of processing 15 million prompts weekly, utilizing Qdrant for vector search, Vertex AI for ML infrastructure and Airflow for task orchestration.

2022 Q1: Built LD's MLOps platform by using tools such as Kubernetes, Vertex AI, Seldon, Prometheus, and Grafana to help data scientists go from EDA to model serving in production quickly. Built a Recommendation Engine using this platform to replace a 3rd party tool called Kibo that will save more than $200k per year on subscription fees.

ZONETV | ML SOFTWARE ENGINEER
June 2017 - Aug 2018 | Toronto, Canada

Built Zone TV's Machine Learning model-serving and re-training infrastructure using Hybrid multi-cloud platform (AWS and Azure).

Built a scalable Recommendation System using Azure Machine Learning and Apache Spark on AWS EMR that is deployed in production. Microsoft Featured this as a successful customer story.

Developed RESTful ML model serving applications using AWS Lambda and API Gateway (leveraging Chalice Framework) and EC2 serving multiple clients like TIVO, Virgin Media UK.
