I'm currently working at Loblaw Digital with extensive experience in machine learning operations, agentic AI, and big data platforms. My career spans from research in machine learning at Toronto Metropolitan University to building production systems that serve millions of users.

At Loblaw Digital, I've designed Alfred - an internal agent orchestration engine using cutting-edge open source technologies like LangGraph, LangFuse, and MCP servers. I've also developed comprehensive MLOps platform - Helios Recommendation Engine - that enable data scientists to go from experimentation to production deployment quickly, saving the company over $200k annually.

My technical expertise includes Agentic AI frameworks, cloud platforms (GCP, AWS, Azure), big data processing (Apache Beam, Spark, Kafka), and modern DevOps practices. I'm passionate about building scalable, reliable systems that make a real impact on business outcomes.

When I'm not architecting complex systems, you can find me speaking at conferences, contributing to open source projects, or exploring the latest developments in AI and machine learning. Outside work, I like playing soccer, traveling and photography.
