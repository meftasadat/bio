      As one of Canada's largest grocery store chains, our team runs several ML systems on production. We wanted to take one such system and integrate it with several MLOps tools including MLflow, Seldon Core, and Feast on Google Cloud Platform. The goal is to reduce overall development time of a model from EDA to deployment, as well as enable end to end tracking of these ML pipelines. 
      In this talk, we will share our experience on setting up a recommender system using the tools mentioned. We will also talk about our overall platform architecture and how the MLOps tools fit into the end-to-end ML pipeline.

      Loblaws is one of Canada's largest grocery store chains, Mefta's team at
      Loblaw Digital runs several ML systems such as search, recommendations,
      inventory, and labor prediction on production. In this conversation,
      he shares his experience setting up their ML platform on GCP using Vertex AI
      and open-source tools. The goal of this platform is to help all the data science
      teams within their organization to take ML projects from EDA to production rapidly
      while ensuring end-to-end tracking of these ML pipelines. We also talk about our overall
      platform architecture and how the MLOps tools fit into the end-to-end ML pipeline.
